# Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure smooth deployment of your Go Fish game.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] All code committed to GitHub
- [ ] Local build works (`cd goFish2 && npm run build`)
- [ ] Local server runs (`cd server && npm start`)
- [ ] Game works locally with both frontend and backend

## Backend Deployment (Render)

- [ ] Signed up at render.com
- [ ] Created Web Service from GitHub repo
- [ ] Set root directory to `server`
- [ ] Build command: `npm install`
- [ ] Start command: `npm start`
- [ ] Added environment variables:
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
  - [ ] `PORT` = `10000`
  - [ ] `CLIENT_URL` = (will add after Vercel)
- [ ] Service deployed successfully
- [ ] Copied backend URL: `_______________________________`
- [ ] Health check works: `https://YOUR-URL/health` returns OK

## Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

- [ ] Signed up at vercel.com
- [ ] Imported GitHub repository
- [ ] Framework preset: Vite
- [ ] Root directory: `goFish2` (or default if vercel.json configured)
- [ ] Added environment variable:
  - [ ] `VITE_SERVER_URL` = `https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com`
- [ ] Deployed successfully
- [ ] Copied frontend URL: `_______________________________`
- [ ] Frontend loads in browser

## Connect Services

- [ ] Updated Render `CLIENT_URL` with Vercel URL
- [ ] Render service redeployed with new env var
- [ ] Both services are running

## Testing

- [ ] Can access frontend at Vercel URL
- [ ] No console errors (check browser DevTools)
- [ ] Can create a room
- [ ] Can copy room code
- [ ] Can join room from another tab/device
- [ ] Players appear in opponent list
- [ ] Can start game (with 2+ players)
- [ ] Cards are dealt
- [ ] Can ask for cards
- [ ] Can draw cards
- [ ] Troller events work:
  - [ ] Octopus troll (black ink screen)
  - [ ] Deck swap troll (card swirl animation)
  - [ ] Earthquake troll (screen shake)
- [ ] Camera feed works (if enabled)
- [ ] Game completes successfully

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Saved production URLs in safe place
- [ ] Shared game link with friends/testers
- [ ] Monitoring set up (optional - UptimeRobot for Render)
- [ ] Updated README with deployment URLs (optional)

## Troubleshooting Reference

If something doesn't work:

1. **Can't connect to server:**
   - Check Render service is running
   - Verify `VITE_SERVER_URL` in Vercel
   - Check browser console for connection errors

2. **CORS errors:**
   - Verify `CLIENT_URL` in Render matches Vercel URL exactly
   - Ensure URLs include `https://`
   - No trailing slashes in URLs

3. **Camera not working:**
   - Must use HTTPS (both platforms provide this)
   - Allow camera permissions in browser
   - Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility

4. **Slow first load:**
   - Normal for Render free tier (cold start ~30-60 seconds)
   - Subsequent loads will be fast
